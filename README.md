# React CRUD application with free API

## About project
In this project you can store informations about users. And you can interact with this data throught API. The CrudCrud provides API for this React app. But there is a limit. Only 100 request allowed and the API lives only 24 hours. So after the project clone you have to change the API.
## Usage 
```
git clone ...
cd react-api-management
npm install
npm start
```
After this you have to visit https://crudcrud.com/ and copy the last part of generated API 'https://crudcrud.com/api/this_part_of_the_url' and paste into the KEY constant in the Table component. That's it. Now you can create/read/update and delete data.
